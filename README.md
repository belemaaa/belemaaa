### Hi, I'm Grace.
I learn, build, improve and relearn. I am a software engineering student and machine learning/AI enthusiast with current expertise in fullstack development. I utilize a range of technologies comprising React JS as my primary frontend library, Node JS, Django, C# and the .NET framework for backend development, and knowledge of C, Java, C++, Visual Basic and Javascript (with constant improvement of my stack).
With time, I aspire to delve deeper into the realms of Machine Learning, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
If you need to reach out to me for any reason, here's my emailðŸ“« ->
