Hi I'm Belema,
I am a frontend developer with a fairly strong command of backend engineering. Currently, I work with React JS as my major frontend library, as well as Django as a backend framework. I also write some programs in HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript, Java and C++.
Feel free to explore some of my open source projects and give reviews if you wish. 
I spend 80% of my day learning, coding and taking up challenges, if you want to reach out to me for any reason, here's my email:
